# SugoiSushi_Java
Sugoi Sushi is an application I created for my advanced object oriented programming course using Java.

Prompt:
Sugoi Sushi is a sushi restaurant in Jeddah that recently opened. Not many customers know or visit the restaurant as much as the owners hoped for.

The owners need help in finding a way to attract more customers.

Solution:
One of the solutions suggested was the creation of an application for the restaurant to attract more customers.

Creating the application will allow more users to order from the restaurant, thus, generating better revenue along with publicity for Sugoi Sushi.

# About the code:
Upon running the program, a login window will pop up whereby the user must input his/her name(characters only) and phone number(10 digits).

After logging in, the user will be able to choose an item from the restaurants menu and proceed to checkout.

Upon checking out, a window will pop up confirming that their order has been placed.

A button will be displayed at the bottom of the screen for the user to exit and a receipt will be printed.
